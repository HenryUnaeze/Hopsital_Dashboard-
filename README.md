# 📌 Patient Wait List – Detailed View Dashboard Analysis
This dashboard offers a detailed breakdown of NHS patient wait lists between January 2018 and September 2020. Unlike high-level summary visuals, this view provides granular insight into specific specialties, patient age profiles, wait time bands, and case types. It is designed to support operational decision-making within clinical departments.

## 🔍 Purpose and Relevance
The key purpose of this dashboard is to highlight which patient groups are waiting the longest and to help identify pressure points across specialties and age profiles. This can help hospital administrators:

- Prioritize patient categories facing critical delays.

- Allocate resources to reduce backlogs.

- Benchmark historical patterns for forecasting future demand.

## 🔧 How the Dashboard Works
Users can filter the view by:

- Archive Date Range

- Case Type (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient)

- Specialty

- Age Profile

- Time Bands (e.g., 0–3, 3–6, 6–9 months, etc.)

The right-hand panel displays a collapsible data grid summarizing the number of patients per selected category.

## 📊 Sample Data Insight (from 31 Jan 2018)
#### Total patients on the wait list: 582,686

- Outpatient: 502,482

- Day Case: 57,267

- Inpatient: 22,937

Focus Segment: Age 0–15

- Total: 82,148 patients

- Cardiology (0–15 age group):

   - 1,232 patients total

   - 454 patients have been waiting 18+ months

   - High wait times also seen in the 3–6 and 6–9 month brackets

Other Specialties:

- Anaesthetics: 18 patients (minor volume, but still delays spread across time bands)

- Breast Surgery: 27 patients (mostly short wait times)

- Cardio-Thoracic Surgery: 15 patients

## 📈 Observations
- Outpatient cases dominate the system (over 85% of total).

- Long waits are most acute in pediatric cardiology, especially for 18+ months.

- Some low-volume specialties (e.g., Breast Surgery) appear under less strain, suggesting more manageable service delivery.

- Clear patterns of wait time distribution by specialty and age can guide policy actions.

## 🔍 Why This Matters
This kind of breakdown is crucial in resource-constrained environments like the NHS. Having visibility into which specialties and which age groups are most affected enables better:

- Scheduling

- Staffing

- Funding allocation

- Strategic intervention planning

## 🚧 Potential Enhancements
- Add patient severity flags to distinguish routine vs urgent cases.

- Introduce visual trend lines for each specialty to supplement the grid.

- Allow drill-down by hospital or region to pinpoint local issues.

## ✅ Summary
This detailed grid view transforms high-volume wait list data into an operationally useful format. It's not just about showing large totals — it reveals who is waiting, how long, and in which specialties the delays are most critical. This can directly inform weekly planning meetings, departmental KPIs, and escalation to NHS Trusts.
